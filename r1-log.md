# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - beastapple

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on Friday 24 January 2025.

## Log

### R1D1 24 Jan
Started a UK companies analysis app. Worked on the project plan and set up the starting files on github - never done that before, so hopefully done it right so far!

### R1D2 25 Jan
Added the ability to upload the CSV, see the "dataframe" within the Streamlit interface and started building out the dashboard space! 

### R1D3 26 Jan
Started filling in the actual dashboard values. Some of the things I thought would be hard are surprisingly simple (checking the uploaded file has the right headers/format) and some of the things I thought would be super simple are taking more googling (e.g. showing a count of a specific column value such as 'Active' companies in 'Company Status').

Some of the resources I have used today:
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-count-occurrences-of-specific-value-in-pandas-column/
- https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/data/st.dataframe
- https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html

### R1D4 27 Jan
Today has been a study day. Lots of active learning but not building on the project - rather, reviewing basics so I can build it right. Spent two hours on learning how to use python to get information needed from a HTML page, e.g. when a webpage doesn't have an API but the data is publicly available. This might be a way to get additional info to support the CSV download, if the Companies House API isn't an option. 

### R1D5 28 Jan
I couldn't get the project to work right with multiple file uploads so I think I need to trigger it somehow to only start the work after all the files have been uploaded, then it needs to check for duplicates, then I can explode the data to analyse the SIC codes. Onwards!

### R1D6 29 Jan
Class day! Today was lesson 6 of 8, whereby we're starting our group projects. We reviewed using APIs in python which was super helpful. I was paired with two people to use python to create a "top trumps" Pokemon game, assigning random pokemon to the player and the opponent. Spent time learning more about how functions work to be able to use them for this example, but also for the companies analysis project. I think that'll help with the issues I had earlier - if I use a button to trigger a function, that should fix the issue. Onwards!

### R1D7 30 Jan
Finished refreshing my [HTML/CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) knowledge ready for some interfaces, per 100dev lessons, and worked on some HTML website files to put it into practice. Pleased by how much I remember despite not working with websites properly for a few years now!

### R1D8 31 Jan
Spent a couple hours on Javascript and comparing javascript uses vs python. Watched [Javascript crash course for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c&ab_channel=TraversyMedia). Fell asleep to a 100devs video and dreamt about Smurfs. 10/10 do not recommend, very bizarre. 

### R1D9 1 Feb
Saturday with no plans means I've had a LOT of time to dig into stuff! Spent a couple hours on 100devs javascript, then a bit the bullet and did a bunch of work on the companies data dashboard. The study from the last couple days has helped a lot but definitely much more valuable to spend time coding. Feeling like it's getting somewhere!
