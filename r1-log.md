# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Anna

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on Friday 24 January 2025.

## Log

### R1D1 24 Jan
Started a UK companies analysis app. Worked on the project plan and set up the starting files on github - never done that before, so hopefully done it right so far!

### R1D2 25 Jan
Added the ability to upload the CSV, see the "dataframe" within the Streamlit interface and started building out the dashboard space! 

### R1D3 26 Jan
Started filling in the actual dashboard values. Some of the things I thought would be hard are surprisingly simple (checking the uploaded file has the right headers/format) and some of the things I thought would be super simple are taking more googling (e.g. showing a count of a specific column value such as 'Active' companies in 'Company Status').

Some of the resources I have used today:
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-count-occurrences-of-specific-value-in-pandas-column/
- https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/data/st.dataframe
- https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html
